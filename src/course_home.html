        <h1>Choose fitness type you desired</h1>
        <p>Fitness can be broadly categorized into several types, 
            each emphasizing different aspects of physical well-being. 
            Aerobic fitness focuses on cardiovascular endurance and overall stamina, 
            incorporating activities like running, swimming, or cycling. 
            Strength training aims to increase muscle mass and strength, 
            involving exercises such as weightlifting or resistance training. 
            Flexibility exercises enhance joint mobility and range of motion, 
            including activities like yoga or stretching routines. 
            Functional fitness emphasizes movements that mimic real-life activities, 
            enhancing balance, coordination, and agility. 
            Lastly, mind-body fitness, such as Pilates or Tai Chi, 
            combines physical movement with mental focus and relaxation techniques to promote overall harmony and mindfulness. 
            With these diverse fitness types, individuals can choose the approach that aligns best with their goals and preferences.</p>
